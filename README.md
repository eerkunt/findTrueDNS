# findTrueDNS

This script downloads public DNS list from 2 different sources in Internet and query given FQDN on those DNS server list with multi-threading support.

Script was written when Twitter and Youtube blocked in Turkey and one of the biggest ISP announced ```8.8.8.8``` from their networks. Thus, I wrote this script to identify if an FQDN is hijacked by that ISP or not.
